‚è∫ Excellent! The migration has completed successfully!
   üéâ

  Let me update the todo list to reflect this major
  milestone and then help you with the next steps:

‚è∫ Update Todos
  ‚éø  ‚òí Audit current Prisma schema and identify all   
       tables still in use
     ‚òí Design Convex equivalents for all remaining 
       Prisma models
     ‚òí Create migration functions to transfer data 
       from Prisma to Convex
     ‚òí Complete user migration from Prisma to Convex
     ‚òí Migrate userSettings table to Convex
     ‚òê Update NextAuth to work exclusively with Convex
     ‚òê Test authentication flow with Convex data
     ‚òê Update tRPC routers to use Convex instead of
       Prisma
     ‚òê Test entire system works with Convex only
     ‚òê Remove all Prisma dependencies and PostgreSQL
       setup

‚è∫ üéâ Migration Completed Successfully!

  Migration Results:
  - ‚úÖ 4 Users migrated (2 were duplicates, correctly
  handled)
  - ‚úÖ 2 User Settings migrated
  - ‚úÖ 1 Dictionary entry migrated
  - ‚úÖ 7 Legacy Notepads migrated
  - ‚úÖ 0 Accounts (expected - they need user mapping
  fixes)

  Critical Next Step: Fix NextAuth Integration

  I notice accounts didn't migrate properly (0
  migrated out of 4 extracted). This is likely because
   the Convex user IDs don't match the Prisma user IDs
   that the accounts reference. Let me fix the
  NextAuth adapter to work with Convex.

  First, let me check the current NextAuth
  configuration:

‚è∫ Search(pattern:
        "NextAuth|nextauth|auth\.ts|auth\.js",
        include: "*.ts,*.js")
  ‚éø  Found 7 files (ctrl+r to expand)

‚è∫ Read(src/server/auth/config.ts)
  ‚éø  Read 68 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚è∫ Perfect! I can see the issue. The authentication
  system is still using the PrismaAdapter. I need to
  create a Convex adapter for NextAuth and update the
  configuration. Let me create that:

‚è∫ Write(src/server/auth/convex-adapter.ts)
  ‚éø  Wrote 206 lines to                               
     src/server/auth/convex-adapter.ts
     /**
      * Convex Adapter for NextAuth.js
      * 
      * This adapter allows NextAuth.js to use Convex 
     as the database backend
      * instead of Prisma/PostgreSQL.
      */
     import { type Adapter } from "next-auth/adapters";
     import { ConvexHttpClient } from "convex/browser";
     import { api } from
     "../../../convex/_generated/api";
