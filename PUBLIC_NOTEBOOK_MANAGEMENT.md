# Public Notebook Management Implementation

## Overview
Implemented full document management capabilities for public notebooks, allowing both logged-in and anonymous users to create, edit, and delete documents in public notebooks (except for deleting the notebook itself).

## Changes Made

### 1. New Convex Functions (`convex/documents.ts`)

#### `createInPublicNotebook`
- Allows anyone to create documents in public notebooks
- Validates that the notebook exists and is public
- Uses the notebook owner as the document owner
- Supports both documents and folders

#### `updateInPublicNotebook`
- Allows anyone to update document titles in public notebooks
- Validates notebook is public before allowing updates

#### `deleteInPublicNotebook`
- Allows anyone to delete documents in public notebooks
- Validates notebook is public before allowing deletion
- Prevents deletion of folders with children

#### `updateStructureInPublicNotebook`
- Allows anyone to reorganize documents in public notebooks
- Supports drag-and-drop functionality for document organization

### 2. Enhanced PublicDocumentSidebar (`src/components_new/PublicDocumentSidebar.tsx`)

#### New Features Added:
- **Document Creation**: "New" dropdown with Document and Folder options
- **Document Deletion**: Delete buttons on all documents and folders
- **Management UI**: Changed from "Read-only" to "Manageable" in header
- **Empty State**: Encourages document creation with action buttons
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during operations

#### Key Functions:
- `handleDeleteDocument`: Manages document deletion with proper error handling
- `handleCreateDocument`: Creates new documents in the public notebook
- `handleCreateFolder`: Creates new folders in the public notebook

### 3. Updated DocumentEditor (`src/components_new/DocumentEditor.tsx`)

#### Changes:
- Added `updateDocumentInPublicNotebook` mutation
- Modified `handleTitleSubmit` to use appropriate update function based on notebook context
- Public notebook documents can now have their titles edited by anyone

### 4. Updated Document Page (`src/app/notas/[url]/[documentId]/page.tsx`)

#### Changes:
- Removed `isReadOnly={!isOwner}` restriction
- Public notebook documents are now fully editable by anyone

## User Experience

### For Public Notebooks:
1. **Anyone can create documents and folders** using the "New" button
2. **Anyone can edit document content** in real-time with collaboration
3. **Anyone can rename documents** by clicking on the title
4. **Anyone can delete documents** using the delete button
5. **Anyone can reorganize documents** by dragging and dropping
6. **Notebook deletion is still restricted** to authenticated users only

### UI Indicators:
- Header shows "Public Notebook (Manageable)" instead of "Read-only"
- Create buttons are prominently displayed
- Empty state encourages document creation
- All management features are enabled

## Security Considerations

### What's Protected:
- **Notebook deletion**: Still requires authentication
- **Private notebooks**: All restrictions remain in place
- **Document ownership**: Documents created in public notebooks are owned by the notebook owner

### What's Open:
- **Document CRUD operations**: Anyone can create, read, update, delete documents
- **Content editing**: Real-time collaborative editing for all users
- **Organization**: Anyone can reorganize document structure

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Convex):
- New mutation functions handle public notebook operations
- Validation ensures operations only work on public notebooks
- Document ownership is automatically set to notebook owner

### Frontend (React):
- PublicDocumentSidebar now includes full management UI
- DocumentEditor supports public notebook title updates
- Proper error handling and loading states throughout

### Type Safety:
- All functions properly typed with Convex schema
- Error handling for invalid operations
- Proper validation of notebook public status

## Testing
- ✅ Development server runs without errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ All new functions properly integrated
- ✅ UI components updated with management features

## Future Enhancements
- Add user attribution for anonymous contributions
- Implement rate limiting for anonymous users
- Add moderation features for public notebooks
- Consider adding approval workflows for sensitive notebooks
