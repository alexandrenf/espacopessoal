### 10. ⏳ migration-010: Clean up old Editor.tsx and related components
**Status**: PENDING
**Dependencies**: migration-009
**Details**: Remove legacy code after successful migration

## Key Files and Components

### New System (DocumentEditor)
- `src/components_new/DocumentEditor.tsx` - Main collaborative editor
- `src/components_new/DocumentSidebar.tsx` - Document navigation
- `src/components_new/SpellCheckSidebar.tsx` - Spell checking functionality
- `src/app/documents/[documentId]/page.tsx` - Document routing
- `convex/` - Backend schema and mutations

### Legacy System (Editor)
- `src/app/components/Editor.tsx` - Legacy editor (TO BE REPLACED)
- `src/app/notas/[url]/` - Current note-taking system
- Related components in `src/app/components/`

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Legacy)
- Traditional React state management
- TRPC for API communication
- Manual saving with debouncing
- Basic text editing with markdown preview

### After (New System)
- Real-time collaborative editing with Y.js
- Convex for real-time backend
- HocusPocus WebSocket server for collaboration
- Rich text editing with TipTap
- Automatic saving via collaboration server

## Technical Challenges Resolved

1. **Real-time Collaboration**: Successfully integrated Y.js + HocusPocus + TipTap stack
2. **Schema Migration**: Created backward-compatible Convex schema supporting existing auth
3. **Spell Check Integration**: Maintained existing spell check API while adapting UI for TipTap
4. **TypeScript Complexity**: Avoided complex TipTap extension typing issues by using component-based approach

## Environment Configuration

The new system requires:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` - WebSocket server URL (defaults to `ws://127.0.0.1:6002`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DENO_API_URL` - Deno API URL for spell checking (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`)
- Convex environment properly configured
